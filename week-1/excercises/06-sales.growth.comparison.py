# Write a program that:
# Creates two lists representing sales for two years:
# 	year_1_sales = [4000, 4500, 4700, 5000, 5200, 4800]
# year_2_sales = [4200, 4600, 4800, 5100, 5300, 4900]
# Calculates:
# Monthly growth percentage: ((Year 2 - Year 1) / Year 1) * 100.
# Overall sales growth for the year.
